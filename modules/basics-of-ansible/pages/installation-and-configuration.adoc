#  Installation and configuration

=== Installation and Configuration

Ansible can be installed on any system that runs one of the following operating systems: Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian), macOS, or Windows (PowerShell). This section will guide you through the installation process on a Linux system, specifically Ubuntu. The process is similar for other supported platforms with slight variations in commands.

#### 1. Update your system's package index

Before installing Ansible, ensure that your system's package list is up-to-date:

```asciidoc
[WARNING]
Ensure you have superuser privileges (using sudo) before executing the following commands to avoid permission issues.

==== Update Package Index

For Ubuntu/Debian based systems, use the following command:

sudo apt update
```

#### 2. Install Ansible

Ansible is available in the default repositories of most Linux distributions including Ubuntu. To install it, run:

```asciidoc
[WARNING]
Ensure you have superuser privileges (using sudo) before executing the following commands to avoid permission issues.

==== Install Ansible

For Ubuntu/Debian based systems, use the following command:

sudo apt install ansible
```

#### 3. Verify the installation

To verify if Ansible was installed successfully, check its version:

```asciidoc
==== Check Ansible Version

Run the following command to display the Ansible version:

ansible --version
```

You should see an output similar to this, confirming that Ansible is correctly installed and ready for use:

```
ansible 2.10.44 (develop-5.3.2-95-g56c1a728) python3 on linux_x86_64
```

#### 4. Configuration

Ansible configuration is handled by a file named `ansible.cfg`. This file contains various settings that customize Ansible's behavior. By default, it's located at `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` for system-wide configuration or in the userâ€™s home directory (`~/.ansible.cfg`) for per-user customization.

To view the current configuration settings:

```asciidoc
==== View Current Configuration

Use the following command to display the contents of the ansible.cfg file:

cat /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg  # For system-wide config
# or
cat ~/.ansible.cfg            # For user-specific config
```

You can edit this file using any text editor (like `nano`, `vim`, or even a graphical editor) with superuser privileges if needed. Remember to save and close the file after making changes.

Now that Ansible is installed and configured on your system, you are ready to proceed to writing simple playbooks in the next section. 

**Hands-on activity suggestion:**

* Attempt to install Ansible on a virtual machine or a spare Linux partition, following these installation steps. This practical exercise reinforces understanding of the installation process and allows learners to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during setup.
